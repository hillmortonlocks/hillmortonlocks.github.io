<h3>From 13th of August 2017 until further notice</h3>
<P>
Due to exceptionally dry weather during the last three months, Hillmorton Locks will be closed overnight.
</P>
 <P> 
This will allow backpumps to circulate water more effectively around the canal network.
 </P>
 <P>  
The locks will be closed between 6.30pm and 9.00am with last entry at 5.00pm.
